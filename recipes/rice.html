    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Furikake Rice first made its debut in episode 2 of Food Wars. Although it is only made of rice, scrambled eggs, chicken, and green onions, this simple dish relies on a secret ingredient to make it special: gelatin cubes. This recipe is a tad difficult if you have little cooking experience, but it gets easier after you’ve prepared the chicken broth.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp of sesame oil</li>
        <li>7-8 chicken wings</li>
        <li>2 tsp of bonito or fish soup stock</li>
        <li>5-6 cups of water for the broth, and ½ cup of water for the gelatin</li>
        <li>2 tsp of grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of sake</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of gelatin</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 green onions</li>
        <li>1 cup of white rice</li>
    </ul>
